In main i want to apply a simple menu logic. 
Users to be able to add information in this case being their age and then get either the standard price or youngdiscount or olderdiscount. 
We need the prices to be added on top of eachother in @MathHandler
ConsoleUI and IUI Will be used to create simplified UI for the menu and text and taking in input and a uint.

1. Tell user that they are in main menu
2. Create a switch statment shell with at least 2 statements
3. create an infinite iteration, something that does not end until we tell it to end. 
4. build out the menu with choice to call upon functions.

Menu choices1 : Youth or Retired
1. User inputs an age
2. Program converts this string into an int 
3. Program checks if user is a youth (below 20) *
4. If true program shall print out( Teen price: 80kr)
5. If Else checks program if person is above 65 
6. If 65 = true Give RetiredPrice 90kr)
7. Else the user is provided standardprice 120kr

Bonus goals: We want the functionality calculate the price for the entire group. 
add it alternatively in the main menu as a 2nd case. It's allowed to use a submenu for this.
We apply first the amount of visits who are going to the movie.
Then ask the age of each person. And then write a total sum in the console which will contain: Amount of visitors and TotalSum.


Clear Ticket will need to utilize .Substring to retrieve the list array in order to delete

words of advice when using User interfaces so i am not too well versed on it.
